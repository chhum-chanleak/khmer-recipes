          Grind the roasted peanuts finely. Heat a frying pan over medium heat, add he shredded coconut meat, and stir-fry for 5 mins until golden brown and smelling fragrant. Set it aside. Meanwhile, cut the fish paper-thin. Toss the fish with 150 ml of the lime juice and 5 g of salt in a mixing bowl (reserve the remaining 25 ml lime juice and 5 g salt for the dressing sauce).Mix the fish gently, and marinate until the flesh of the fish is firm and opaque, about 15 mins. Gently squeeze the fish to release about 80% of the lime juice.
