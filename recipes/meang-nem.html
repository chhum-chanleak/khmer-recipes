    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The combination of roasted rice powder lifts this classic salad dish to an unforgettable taste. Walking
      through the ingredient list, you might think that the taste will be dominated by citrusy and tart tastes
      because in the dressing we use lime juice, bitter lime juice and the brine from pickled scallion heads.
      However, combined with the other ingredients, the taste becomes sweet and sour, and goes perfectly
      with some leafy greens and vegetables. Furthermore, this salad is good for vegetarians because there
      are only two proteins (dried shrimp and fish sauce) which can easily be eliminated from the recipe.
